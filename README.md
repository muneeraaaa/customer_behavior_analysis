# Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

*A Data Analytics Case Study*

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer shopping behavior using transactional retail data to uncover insights into **revenue drivers, customer segmentation, product performance, and subscription behavior**. The goal is to translate raw purchase data into **actionable business insights** that can support pricing strategy, retention efforts, and targeted marketing.

The analysis combines **Python for data preparation**, **SQL for analytical querying**, and **Power BI for visualization**, following a realistic end-to-end data analytics workflow.

## 🎯 Business Questions Addressed

The analysis focuses on the following key questions:

1. What is the total revenue generated by male vs. female customers?
2. Which customers used discounts but still spent above the average purchase amount?
3. Which products have the highest average review ratings?
4. How does average spending differ by shipping type?
5. How do subscribers and non-subscribers compare in terms of spending and revenue?
6. Which products are most dependent on discounts?
7. How can customers be segmented into New, Returning, and Loyal groups?
8. What are the top 3 most purchased products within each category?
9. Are repeat buyers more likely to subscribe?
10. What is the revenue contribution of each age group?

## 📊 Dataset Description

* **Type:** Retail transactional data
* **Observations:** ~3,900 purchase records
* **Features include:**

  * Customer demographics (age, gender, location)
  * Purchase details (item, category, amount, season, size)
  * Behavioral indicators (previous purchases, purchase frequency)
  * Promotions (discount applied, promo code usage)
  * Subscription status and review ratings

---

## 🧹 Data Preparation & Feature Engineering (Python)

Data cleaning and preparation were performed using **pandas**, including:

* Standardizing column names to snake_case
* Handling missing values in review ratings using **category-level median imputation**
* Verifying consistency between discount indicators
* Creating engineered features:

  * **age_group** (quantile-based segmentation)
  * **purchase_frequency_days** (normalized purchase frequency)
  * Customer loyalty classification based on purchase history

---

## 🧠 Data Analysis (SQL)

Analytical queries were executed using **SQL** to answer business-driven questions. Key techniques applied include:

* Aggregations (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`)
* Conditional logic using `CASE`
* Subqueries for comparative analysis
* Window functions (`ROW_NUMBER`) to rank products within categories
* Customer segmentation and behavioral analysis

Query results were exported and used as inputs for visualization.

## 📈 Data Visualization (Power BI)

An interactive dashboard was built in **Power BI Desktop** to communicate insights clearly and effectively. The dashboard includes:

* KPI cards (number of customers, average spend, average rating)
* Revenue breakdowns by gender, category, and age group
* Customer segmentation visuals
* Product and discount dependency analysis
* Interactive filters for deeper exploration

---

## 💡 Key Insights

* Loyal customers form the largest segment, indicating strong retention potential
* Certain products rely heavily on discounts, posing possible margin risks
* Repeat buyers show a higher likelihood of subscription adoption
* Revenue contribution varies significantly across age groups
* Express shipping users tend to have slightly higher average spending

---

## 📌 Business Recommendations

* Strengthen loyalty programs to convert repeat buyers into subscribers
* Review discount strategies for products with high discount dependency
* Focus marketing efforts on high-revenue age groups
* Align shipping incentives with higher-value customer segments

---

## ⚠️ Limitations & Future Work

* No time-series data available for cohort or churn analysis
* Absence of cost data prevents margin evaluation
* Future work could include predictive modeling for subscription conversion and customer lifetime value
